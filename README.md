# sim_chain_cryptocurrency_lerning_project
This is my learning project to build a Blockchain in the object-oriented programming style.

I called it as "sim-chain".

I've learned and implemented some features:

-Generate hashes for blocks in the chain.

-Unit Test Components of the Blockchain.

-Create an API around the Blockchain.

-Create a real-time connected peer-to-peer server.

-Implement a proof-of-work algorithm.

-Sign Transactions with cryptography and digital signature.

-Create a Transaction Pool for a real-time list of incoming data.

-Include transactions in core blocks of the chain.
